0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples 
 lists:
Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.
Tuples and Sequences:
We saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as indexing and slicing operations. They are two examples of sequence data typesSince Python is an evolving language, other sequence data types may be added. There is also another standard sequence data type: the tuple.

A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas
